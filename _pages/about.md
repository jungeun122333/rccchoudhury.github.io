I'm a PhD student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Kris Kitani](https://kriskitani.github.io/) and [László Jeni](https://www.laszlojeni.com/). I'm supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) Fellowship, and have spent time during my PhD at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/). working with Jing Huang.

I'm broadly interested in making video understanding faster and more efficient. In particular, I work on enabling vision algorithms to continuously perceive the world in high resolution and at 30+ FPS. 

Before starting my PhD, I was a software engineer at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/), where I worked on trajectory forecasting models for self-driving vehicles. Even before that, I graduated from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I worked on multi-agent reinforcement learning with [Yisong Yue](https://www.yisongyue.com/). 

Outside of research, I enjoy running, lifting weights, watching sports and listening to electronic music.
