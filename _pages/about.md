I'm a 4th-year PhD student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Kris Kitani](https://kriskitani.github.io/) and [László Jeni](https://www.laszlojeni.com/). I'm supported in part by an [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) Fellowship.

I'm broadly interested in making video understanding faster and more efficient. In particular, I work on enabling vision algorithms to continuously perceive the world in high resolution and at 30+ FPS. 

During my graduate studies, I've spent time as a research intern at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/) (with Jing Huang).

Before starting my PhD, I was a software engineer at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/), where I worked on trajectory forecasting models for self-driving vehicles. Even before that, I graduated from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). When I'm not working on research, I enjoy running, lifting weights, and listening to electronic music.
