I'm a 4th-year PhD student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Kris M. Kitani and Laszlo Jeni. 

I'm broadly interested in making video understanding faster and more efficient. In particular, I'm working on enabling vision algorithms to perceive the world in high resolution and at 30+ FPS. 

During my graduate studies, I've spent time as a research intern at Meta FAIR (with Jing Huang).
Before starting my PhD, I was a software engineer at Nuro, where I worked on trajectory forecasting models for self-driving vehicles. Even before that, I graduated from Caltech. 

When I'm not working on research, I enjoy running, lifting weights, listening to electronic music and reading manga.
