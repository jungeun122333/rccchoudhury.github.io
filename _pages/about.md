I'm a fourth-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by [Kris Kitani](https://kriskitani.github.io/) and [László Jeni](https://www.laszlojeni.com/). My research broadly focuses on making visual models more efficient at understanding and generating visual content, particularly enabling algorithms to continuously perceive the world at high resolution and real-time frame rates (30+ FPS). My work is supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) Fellowship.

Currently, I'm also a Student Researcher at [ByteDance](https://team.doubao.com/en/), collaborating with [Peter Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanchuanlin/) and [Lu Jiang](http://www.lujiang.info/) on accelerating video generation. 
Previously, I interned at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/), working with [Jing Huang](https://superirabbit.github.io/) on efficient video understanding.

Before my PhD, I was a software engineer at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/), developing trajectory forecasting models for self-driving vehicles, and even earlier I earned my bachelor's degree from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), where I explored multi-agent reinforcement learning with [Yisong Yue](https://www.yisongyue.com/).

Outside of research, I enjoy running, weightlifting, watching sports, and listening to electronic music.
